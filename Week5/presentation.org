#+TITLE: Presentation
* Begreber
+ Epistemic
+ Epistimology
+ Prima facie
+ epistemological problem
+ Inconsistent family of models => context
+ Parker ensemble prediction
  + Unknown initial conditions and parameter
  + Find things that are invariant
+ Robutness analysis(ostensibly) - invariance
+ Information not confirmation
  + Interested in what the model can coherently say about target sytem

* Mutually inconsistent
+ Factually
+ Conceptually inconsistent

* Section 2
+ scientific theory is a collection of models and assumptions
+ Models of theories
+ Model of target system
+ Models as scientific devices
+ Factually inconsistent models
  + Different initial conditions and parameter setting
  + Same assumptions
+ Nogle modeller kan bruge forskellige representation af target system uden at vÃ¦re inkonsistente
+ Incompatable assumption from idealizing
  + Auxillary assumptions
+ Substantial assumption
+ Robustness analysis - results are invarent when changing auxillary but keeping substantial
+ =Conceptually inconsistent models=
  + Conflicting substantial assumptions
  + Prima facie about how they can cohenretly agree on claims about target system

* Section 3
+ Realist view
  + Epistemic value = representional accuracy
  + prima facie how inconsistent models can have epistemic value
+ Anti-realist vieiw
  + Epistemic value of explanatory power
  + coherent explanation
+ Inconsistency in scientific disagreement -> inconsistent models
+ =Perspectival realism=
  + Members in family of inconsistent models views the target system from different perspectives
  + Target system exhibits different properties
+ =Model pluralism=
  + Bag of trick to view target system in context
  + Models for different purposes
+ These types of inconstant models avoid epistemic problems
+ Ensemble methods are bad because the tell with a probability whether something is true not why
+ Most important is inconsistent model with incompatible substantial assumptions
+ Even though models ascribe the core structure they can still share a common structure
  + This grounds shared informations
+ Find causual core structure in robustness analysis
  + Mathematically - differntial equation
  + Empirically
+ =Shared peripheral structure=
